# AND GATE
The AND gate is a basic digital logic gate that implements logical conjunction (∧) from mathematical logic – AND gate behaves according to the truth table above. A HIGH output (1) results only if all the inputs to the AND gate are HIGH (1). If none or not all inputs to the AND gate are HIGH, LOW output results. The function can be extended to any number of inputs.
