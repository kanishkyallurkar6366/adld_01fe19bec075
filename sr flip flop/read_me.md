# SR Flip-Flop
An SR Flip Flop is short for Set-Reset Flip Flop. It has two inputs S(Set) and R(Reset) and two outputs Q(normal output) and Q'(inverted output).
Flip Flops are the basic building blocks of sequential circuits. They are memory elements made by connecting logic gates. They can shift between two states (0 and 1) and hence, formally called bi-stable multivibrator.
