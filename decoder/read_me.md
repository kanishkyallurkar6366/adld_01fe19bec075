# Decoder
Decoder is a digital circuit which takes some inputs and decodes it and provides a decoded output.
In this oroject a 3:8 bit encoder is designed using verilog in ISE xilinx .  Decoders are characterized by their sizes which are written in the form ( N x 2^N ) for an N- bit Decoder.Decoders also have some enable pins so that while working in systems, we can enable them or disable them purposely. Enable pin can be active Low or active High. Active Low means when enable pin will be low, the decoder will be enabled and Active High means when enable pin will be high, the decoder will be enabled. Both have major significances but active low is preferred because providing ground to a pin is easier and profitable than High voltage.
